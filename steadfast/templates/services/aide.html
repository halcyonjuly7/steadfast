				The Home Health Aides (HHA) provides personal care and related services to patients in their home. They function under the direction, instruction and supervision of a Registered Nurse, the Direction of Nursing or Designee and/or appropriate supervisor like a Physical Therapist (PT). Our HHAs have successfully completed a state-established competency evaluation also known as a state licensure program.
			</p>
			<p>
			After a RN or PT prepares a written Plan of Care (POC) the HHA works closely with the patients providing the following services:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bathing (Bed bath, shower, shower chair, tub)</li>
				<li>grooming (oral care, comb hair, shampoo, skin care, shave, nail care except diabetics, perineal care-Catheter care</li>
				<li>vital signs (temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure)</li>
				<li>Activities of Daily Living
					<ol>
						<li>Assist with transfers (Hoyer lift, wheel chair)</li>
						<li>Assist with ambulation (walker, cane, crutches)</li>
						<li>Assist with dressing or dress the patient</li>
						<li>Make or change bed</li>
						<li>Tidy area</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Knowledge of Agency established parameters and various reportable conditions</li>
				<li>Miscellaneous Duties
					<ol>
						<li>laundry</li>
						<li>grocery</li>
						<li>medication pick-ups</li>
						<li>light house keeping</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A home health aide service alone without an appropriate and medically necessary skilled nursing care may not be provided under the Medicare Coverage Guidelines for Home Health Agencies.
